What kind of art did you study in college?
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
I went to Washington University in St. Louis, Sam Fox School of Design and Visual Art. My degree is a Bachelor of Fine Art in Painting from 2012. Um but shortly after I graduated, years after or so, they reorganzied the curriculum so it was more multi-disciplinary which I think better reflects what I was doing and maybe they were seeing that trend of people who thought they were going to be painters, but a lot of people in the painting department did a lot of sculpture and textile and papermaking and video. They were pulling, trying to get time with other professors and MFA students who were painters and not painters somy degree is technically in paitning but I don't know if my proessors would agree with that.
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
What did art mean for you at the time when you were studying?
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
For me I was lucky that it wasn't a question of what do I want to do, it was will I be able to. It was always really obvious that if I had the choice of anything. So it wasn't a hard decision it was how to make it possible. You know? I don't really have a uh existenial question of what would I like to major in. Well what I would like is this. Is it possible? So. 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
Has this perception changed since you've left "art school"?
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
Um I think my perception of, I mean yes, because my perception of ymself has changed where um I come from, my immediate family success was really importnt to them, and specifically academic success was really important to them and like working really hard to be "successful" was really important to them and I hadn't yet identified that that was not important to me. Um. like the ways that I was trying to achieve something, I didn't even know where to be facing to be doing to be a good person in the world were based on defitions by family. And you know that is how they serve themselves in the world and not me. So it took after I graduated to figre that out. I did not figure that out in school. It took me to leave school ....This is not important to me. Um. To be a person who works really hard. It's important to me.. other things are important, conneciton and time with peple, and spirituality, is more imporant to me than like um external enviromwnt success not to say i don't enjoy it or I don't fall into a habit that I have to be conscious of, so art was serving one of those things before and it is serving another thing now. It was serving those before but kind of with a little dirty mix in there. Whereas now, I'm pretty honest with myself that well. Does that make sense?
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
How do fit art into your life now and what does that look like?
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
Yeah, well I am a person who really benefits from structure, um, not just like... if I wondering in the woods alone I would just lay down thre in one spot and zone and commune forever and never bathe. I really benefit from structures. You know, artificial imagined... and things like that and for me what had to happen was that I had to get rid of the bar where it was still going to look like what I made in school like when I am working, which I have to work, it's not going to look like what I made in school and put some structues around it. So Regan has actuall helped me come up with series that I work on everyday so I don't have to redecide everyday, you know. So like doing it everyday and acepting teh fact that its not going to be as much time as I want. Alos more recently since the pandmic I have neen freelandicng and doing part time gigs which has been much eaier to work art in, ather than the full time, I don't know how the full-time peiple do it, cause when I have had full time jobs, I haven't made art and it was pretty miserable, even though they were good jobs that I believed in, I'm glad I did them but it was jsut, when you have a full, espcailly if its a non-profit, and youre trying to do the best you can, and its short staffed vecasye its a non-profit, it';s very hard to make art at the same time. But you are never not an artist. You are creative in your job, but its not for you, to say, it's for what the mission says, and you put your whole soul into that, well I was, so now like the last few years, doing freelance, and everythng has made it a lot more possible, and to be able to take a week off and have time to just make art with courses and everything. I haven't been the most successful person at like making a whol lot since cause i have to work and not be funded, like I havem't done the grants and residenceis and all that stuff, funding, cause I like to keep it very separate. These people and funding, I have other things that keep my life stable and I keep those separate. But I really admire people that are like I'm going to figure out how to do art and make it financially stable. And maybe that will change. But I like to keep them really separate. Like it doesn't confuse anything. I literally make whatever I want and has no conneciton with my paycheck whatsoever. 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
What do you think art could do? Reflecting on your own art education what do wish you had been told?
<p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> 
For me, something I wish I had...figured out earlier, not been told, but figured out for myself earlier, was that um you have to let people see it. Because I was really okay now I've left art school and there's no critique, and I was waiting for feeling like it was really enough before asking for anyboyd to look, and that's where you deadend and where I dead-ended. You are never aren't an artist and you are like suppressing your soul when you don't put it out there I feel like and um maybe it's not what you want it to be, but if you don't put it out there, it gets buried darker and darker and harder to find. And during time where I was working a lot and not showing, it wasn't completing the circle enough and I thought it was, but for me, I am not about meeting people to look at me, it's not look at me, it's look at this and like we can meetin the middle here and yeah. So that would be one thing for me. And what can it do?
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
Or what could it do that it's not doing?
<p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> 
Okay, so to get a little political... cause it's hard not to answer this in a trite way but maybe as one angle that has been, okay so I've been reading this book called Unhoused: Adorno and the Problem of Dwelling by Matthew Waggoner, um, I'm not going to be able to process it back out in my own words but its been making me think about how much we rely on mass-produced everyhting and the way that that really affects the community, because we can't relate to made our toold for us and everyhting becomes uh infinitley available to us and therefore everything is pointless becuase we don't apprecaite it. And so that extends then to people. When we treat our objects as infinitely available and therfore disposable, you do the same to people. So that is why I love obecjts and treat them like sacred things vene if thet are you know for me, usually ready-made simplethings. you know . Myabe mass-produced but treating them like hand-made. So that is my art. I haven't written an art statemtnt sicne art school!
