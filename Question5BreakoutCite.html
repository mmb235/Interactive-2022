<h1>What do you think art could do? Reflecting on your own art education what do wish you had been told?</h1>

     For me, something I wish I had figured out earlier, not been told, but figured out for myself earlier, was that,um, you have to let people see it. I was like now I've left art school and there are no critiques, and I was waiting for the feeling like that it was really enough before asking for anybody to look, and that's where you dead-end and where I dead-ended. You never aren't an artist and you are like suppressing your soul when you don't put it out there, I feel like, and, um, maybe it's not what you want it to be, but if you don't put it out there, it gets buried darker and darker and becomes harder to find. And during the time where I was working a lot and not showing, it wasn't completing the circle enough even though I thought it was. But for me, I am not about meeting people to look at me, it's not look at me, it's look at this and like we can meet in the middle here. So that would be one thing for me. And what can it do?

    Okay, so to get a little political... cause it's hard not to answer this in a trite way but maybe as one angle, um, so I've been reading this book called <a href="https://www.arch.columbia.edu/books/catalog/312-unhoused-adorno-and-the-problem-of-dwelling">Unhoused: Adorno and the Problem of Dwelling by Matthew Waggoner</a>, um, I'm not going to be able to process it back out in my own words but its been making me think about how much we rely on mass-produced everything and the way that that really affects the community, because we can't relate to who made our tools for us and everything becomes um infinitley available to us; therefore, everything is pointless because we don't appreciate it. And so that extends then to people. When we treat our objects as infinitely available and therefore disposable, you do the same to people. So that is why I love objects and treat them like sacred things even if that for me, usually is ready-made simple, things. You know? Maybe mass-produced but treating them like they are hand-made. So that is my art.</div>

    I wish my education has been framed inside white Christian supremacy. So that I could understand that it was one way of doing and looking and being and not the way. And acually being really residtatn with Regan, as much as I want to, but so much of the isntruction in a way that is inspring, is rooted in showing us other works and showing us a sotry and naarative and I just don't know what palce I have in that story. And I want an alterantive art hsitroy to locate myself in. So i am really conscious about choosing to spend my time and energy with a history that is alientating to me but even that is a pricless. It may not be that I can't get something out of that, I don't know. I don't feel like investing in it. I still don't if that's cutting my nose to spite my face. I wish that my educaition then and the education I continue to seek out had been framed within these larger cultural forces that create them. I wish they had been more self-aware. I don't think any one person or institution can unwind these things on its own, but even a little bit of seld-wareness that is like this is what we are and this is what we aren't, this is what we knwo, this is what we do know, would help I think soomeone like me, or all students, all artist in formation, impressionale minds, to leave a little space for some questions. Becuase even if Wshington University didn't habe the answers for me, I think it would have been grat to knwo that there were questions in the first place. So I could I could those answers out somehwere else. </div>
