  <h1><font size=7>Last year I took a collage workshop called "Reuse Reinterpret Reedit: Mixed Media" where I spent an entire week on zoom with a group of ten artists of varying ages. We went on to curate an exhibit the following summer titled, "Found at the Garden" that took place in New Paltz, New York at the Wild Arts Collective. We are in the midst of planning our next exhibition for this May. I have only met one of them in-person but we have maintained a long distance artist community. I interviewed two of the artists, Annie Sarachan and Vidya Cowsik Santosh, broadly about their experience in art school and their post-graduate lives. </font></h1>
