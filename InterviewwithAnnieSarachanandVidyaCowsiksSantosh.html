<h1>Last year I took a collage workshop called <i>"Reuse Reinterpret Reedit: Mixed Media"</i> taught by Regan Wheat, our shared mentor, using the curriculum of Florence-based duo, Rosenclaire. where I spent an entire week on zoom with a group of ten artists of varying ages. We went on to curate an exhibit the following summer titled, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/foundatthegarden/?hl=en">"Found at the Garden"</a> that took place in New Paltz, New York at the <a href="https://www.wearewildarts.com">Wild Arts Collective</a>.We are in the midst of planning our next exhibition for this May. I have only met one of them in-person but we have maintained a long distance artist community. I interviewed two of the artists, <a href="https://www.anniesarachan.com/">Annie Sarachan</a> and <a href="https://withvidya.com/about">Vidya Cowsik Santosh</a> broadly about their experience in art school and their post-graduate lives. <a href="QuestionsLink.html">Check out the interviews here....</a> </h1>
