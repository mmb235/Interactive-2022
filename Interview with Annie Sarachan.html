What kind of art did you study in college?
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
I went to Washington University in St. Louis, Sam Fox School of Design and Visual Art. My degree is a Bachelor of Fine Art in Painting from 2012. Um but shortly after I graduated, years after or so, they reorganzied the curriculum so it was more multi-disciplinary which I think better reflects what I was doing and maybe they were seeing that trend of people who thought they were going to be painters, but a lot of people in the painting department did a lot of sculpture and textile and papermaking and video. They were pulling, trying to get time with other professors and MFA students who were painters and not painters somy degree is technically in paitning but I don't know if my proessors would agree with that.

What did art mean for you at the time when you were studying?
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
For me I was lucky that it wasn't a question of what do I want to do, it was will I be able to. It was always really obvious that if I had the choice of anything. So it wasn't a hard decision it was how to make it possible. You know? I don't really have a uh existenial question of what would I like to major in. Well what I would like is this. Is it possible? So.

Has this perception changed since you've left "art school"?
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
Um I think my perception of, I mean yes, because my perception of ymself has changed where um I come from, my immediate family success was really importnt to them, and specifically academic success was really important to them
