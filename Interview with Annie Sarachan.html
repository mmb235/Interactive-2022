<b><marquee behavior="slide" direction="left">What kind of art did you study in college?</marquee></b></font>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<font size="7">I went to Washington University in St. Louis,<a href="https://samfoxschool.wustl.edu/"> Sam Fox School of Design and Visual Arts</a>. My degree is a Bachelor of Fine Art in Painting from 2012. Um, but shortly after I graduated, years after or so, they reorganized the curriculum so it was more multi-disciplinary which I think better reflects what I was doing and maybe they were seeing that trend of people who thought they were going to be painters, but a lot of people in the painting department did a lot of sculpture and textile and papermaking and video. They were pulling, trying to get time with other professors and MFA students who were painters and not painters, so my degree is technically in painting but I don't know if my professors would agree with that.</font>

<b><marquee behavior="slide" direction="left">What did art mean for you at the time when you were studying?</marquee></b></font>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<font size="7">For me I was lucky that it wasn't a question of what do I want to do, it was will I be able to?
It was always really obvious that if I had the choice of anything, it would be art... So it wasn't a hard decision it was how to make it possible. You know? I didn't really have an, uh, existenial question of what would I like to major in. Well, what I would like is this. Is it possible? So. </font>

<marquee behavior="slide" direction="left"> <div><font size="6"><b>Has this perception changed since you've left "art school"?</b></marquee>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<font size="7">I think my perception has. I mean yes...because my perception of myself has changed. Where, um, I come from, to my immediate family, success was really important to them, and specifically academic success was really important to them. Like working really hard to be "successful" was really important to them and I hadn't yet identified that that was not important to me. Like the ways that I was trying to achieve something, I didn't even know where to be facing. What I was doing to be a good person in the world was based on definitions by my family. And you know that is how they serve themselves in the world and not me. So it took after I graduated to figrue that out. I did not figure that out in school. It took me leaving school to learn that this is not important to me, um, to be a person who works really hard. Other things are important: connection and time with people, and spirituality, is more important to me than like um external environmental success. Not to say I don't enjoy it or I don't fall into a habit that I have to be conscious of, so art was serving one of those things before and it is serving another thing now. It was serving those before in school but kind of with a little dirty mix in there. Does that make sense?</font>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <div><font size="6">
<b><marquee behavior="slide" direction="left">How do fit art into your life now and what does that look like?</marquee></font></b>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<font size="7">Yeah, well I am a person who really benefits from structure. If I'm wondering in the woods alone I would just lay down there in one spot and zone and commune forever and never bathe. I really benefit from structures. For me what had to happen was that I had to get rid of the bar that [my art] was still going to look like what I made in school. When I am working, which I have to work, it's not going to look like what I made in school. I put some structues around it. So Regan has actually helped me come up with a series that I work on everyday so I don't have to redecide everyday, you know. So like doing it everyday and accepting the fact that its not going to be as much time as I want. Also more recently since the pandemic, I have been free-lancing and doing part time gigs which has been much easier to work art in, rather than the full time work. I don't know how full-time people do it, cause when I have had full time jobs, I haven't made art and it was pretty miserable, even though they were good jobs that I believed in, I'm glad I did them but it was just, when you have a full day, especially if its a non-profit, and you're trying to do the best you can, and its short staffed, because its a non-profit, it's very hard to make art at the same time. But you are never not an artist. You are creative in your job, but its not for you, to say, it's for what the mission says, and you put your whole soul into that, well I was, so now like the last few years, doing freelance, and everything, has made it a lot more possible, and to be able to take a week off and have time to just make art with courses and everything. I haven't been the most successful person at like making a whole lot since [I graduated] cause I have to work and not be funded. I haven't done the grants and residenceis and all that stuff, funding, cause I like to keep it very separate. I have other things that keep my life stable and I keep those separate. But I really admire people that are like I'm going to figure out how to do art and make it financially stable. And maybe that will change. But I like to keep them really separate. It doesn't confuse anything. I literally make whatever I want and it has no connection with my paycheck whatsoever. </font>

<marquee behavior="slide" direction="left"><b>What do you think art could do? Reflecting on your own art education what do wish you had been told?</b></marquee></font>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font size="7">For me, something I wish I had figured out earlier, not been told, but figured out for myself earlier, was that,um, you have to let people see it. I was like now I've left art school and there are no critiques, and I was waiting for the feeling like that it was really enough before asking for anybody to look, and that's where you dead-end and where I dead-ended. You never aren't an artist and you are like suppressing your soul when you don't put it out there, I feel like, and, um, maybe it's not what you want it to be, but if you don't put it out there, it gets buried darker and darker and becomes harder to find. And during the time where I was working a lot and not showing, it wasn't completing the circle enough even though I thought it was. But for me, I am not about meeting people to look at me, it's not look at me, it's look at this and like we can meet the middle here. So that would be one thing for me. And what can it do?</font>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>  <div><font size="6">
<marquee behavior="slide" direction="left"><b>Yes or what could it do that it's not doing?</b></marquee></font>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font size="7">Okay, so to get a little political... cause it's hard not to answer this in a trite way but maybe as one angle, um, so I've been reading this book called <a href="https://www.arch.columbia.edu/books/catalog/312-unhoused-adorno-and-the-problem-of-dwelling">Unhoused: Adorno and the Problem of Dwelling by Matthew Waggoner</a>, um, I'm not going to be able to process it back out in my own words but its been making me think about how much we rely on mass-produced everything and the way that that really affects the community, because we can't relate to who made our tools for us and everything becomes um infinitley available to us; therefore, everything is pointless becuase we don't appreciate it. And so that extends then to people. When we treat our objects as infinitely available and therefore disposable, you do the same to people. So that is why I love objects and treat them like sacred things even if that for me, usually is ready-made simple, things. You know? Maybe mass-produced but treating them like they are hand-made. So that is my art.</font>
