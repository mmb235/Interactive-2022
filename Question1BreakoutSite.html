<h1>What kind of art did you study in college?</h1>

    <div>Annie:
        I went to Washington University in St. Louis,<a href="https://samfoxschool.wustl.edu/"> Sam Fox School of Design and Visual Arts</a>. My degree is a Bachelor of Fine Art in Painting from 2012. Um, but shortly after I graduated, years after or so, they reorganized the curriculum so it was more multi-disciplinary which I think better reflects what I was doing and maybe they were seeing that trend of people who thought they were going to be painters, but a lot of people in the painting department did a lot of sculpture and textile and papermaking and video. They were pulling, trying to get time with other professors and MFA students who were painters and not painters, so my degree is technically in painting but I don't know if my professors would agree with that.</div>

    Alright the first part's easy. I attended Washington University in St. Louis and I majored in Communication Design. Um which was a two-year um concentration that followed two years of a studio art foundation program. Um help me with the next part of the question. What was it again?</div>
