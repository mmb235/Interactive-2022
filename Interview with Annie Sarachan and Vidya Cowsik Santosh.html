<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<font size="7"><p style="text-indent: 80px">I went to Washington University in St. Louis,<a href="https://samfoxschool.wustl.edu/"> Sam Fox School of Design and Visual Arts</a>. My degree is a Bachelor of Fine Art in Painting from 2012. Um, but shortly after I graduated, years after or so, they reorganized the curriculum so it was more multi-disciplinary which I think better reflects what I was doing and maybe they were seeing that trend of people who thought they were going to be painters, but a lot of people in the painting department did a lot of sculpture and textile and papermaking and video. They were pulling, trying to get time with other professors and MFA students who were painters and not painters, so my degree is technically in painting but I don't know if my professors would agree with that.</font>

<b><marquee behavior="slide" direction="left">What did art mean for you at the time when you were studying?</marquee></b></font>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<font size="7"><p style="text-indent: 80px">For me I was lucky that it wasn't a question of what do I want to do, it was will I be able to?
It was always really obvious that if I had the choice of anything, it would be art... So it wasn't a hard decision it was how to make it possible. You know? I didn't really have an, uh, existenial question of what would I like to major in. Well, what I would like is this. Is it possible? So. </font>

}
<font size"7"><p style="text-indent: 80px">I think my perception has. I mean yes...because my perception of myself has changed. Where, um, I come from, to my immediate family, success was really important to them, and specifically academic success was really important to them. Like working really hard to be "successful" was really important to them and I hadn't yet identified that that was not important to me. Like the ways that I was trying to achieve something, I didn't even know where to be facing. What I was doing to be a good person in the world was based on definitions by my family. And you know that is how they serve themselves in the world and not me. So it took after I graduated to figrue that out. I did not figure that out in school. It took me leaving school to learn that this is not important to me, um, to be a person who works really hard. Other things are important: connection and time with people, and spirituality, is more important to me than like um external environmental success. Not to say I don't enjoy it or I don't fall into a habit that I have to be conscious of, so art was serving one of those things before and it is serving another thing now. It was serving those before in school but kind of with a little dirty mix in there. Does that make sense?</font>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <div><font size="6">
<b><marquee behavior="slide" direction="left">How do fit art into your life now and what does that look like?</marquee></font></b>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<font size="7"><p style="text-indent: 80px">Yeah, well I am a person who really benefits from structure. If I'm wondering in the woods alone I would just lay down there in one spot and zone and commune forever and never bathe. I really benefit from structures. For me what had to happen was that I had to get rid of the bar that [my art] was still going to look like what I made in school. When I am working, which I have to work, it's not going to look like what I made in school. I put some structues around it. So Regan has actually helped me come up with a series that I work on everyday so I don't have to redecide everyday, you know. So like doing it everyday and accepting the fact that its not going to be as much time as I want. Also more recently since the pandemic, I have been free-lancing and doing part time gigs which has been much easier to work art in, rather than the full time work. I don't know how full-time people do it, cause when I have had full time jobs, I haven't made art and it was pretty miserable, even though they were good jobs that I believed in, I'm glad I did them but it was just, when you have a full day, especially if its a non-profit, and you're trying to do the best you can, and its short staffed, because its a non-profit, it's very hard to make art at the same time. But you are never not an artist. You are creative in your job, but its not for you, to say, it's for what the mission says, and you put your whole soul into that, well I was, so now like the last few years, doing freelance, and everything, has made it a lot more possible, and to be able to take a week off and have time to just make art with courses and everything. I haven't been the most successful person at like making a whole lot since [I graduated] cause I have to work and not be funded. I haven't done the grants and residenceis and all that stuff, funding, cause I like to keep it very separate. I have other things that keep my life stable and I keep those separate. But I really admire people that are like I'm going to figure out how to do art and make it financially stable. And maybe that will change. But I like to keep them really separate. It doesn't confuse anything. I literally make whatever I want and it has no connection with my paycheck whatsoever. </font>

<marquee behavior="slide" direction="left"><b>What do you think art could do? Reflecting on your own art education what do wish you had been told?</b></marquee></font>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font size="7"><p style="text-indent: 80px">For me, something I wish I had figured out earlier, not been told, but figured out for myself earlier, was that,um, you have to let people see it. I was like now I've left art school and there are no critiques, and I was waiting for the feeling like that it was really enough before asking for anybody to look, and that's where you dead-end and where I dead-ended. You never aren't an artist and you are like suppressing your soul when you don't put it out there, I feel like, and, um, maybe it's not what you want it to be, but if you don't put it out there, it gets buried darker and darker and becomes harder to find. And during the time where I was working a lot and not showing, it wasn't completing the circle enough even though I thought it was. But for me, I am not about meeting people to look at me, it's not look at me, it's look at this and like we can meet the middle here. So that would be one thing for me. And what can it do?</font>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>  <div><font size="6">
<marquee behavior="slide" direction="left"><b>Yes or what could it do that it's not doing?</b></marquee></font>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font size="7">Okay, so to get a little political... cause it's hard not to answer this in a trite way but maybe as one angle, um, so I've been reading this book called <a href="https://www.arch.columbia.edu/books/catalog/312-unhoused-adorno-and-the-problem-of-dwelling">Unhoused: Adorno and the Problem of Dwelling by Matthew Waggoner</a>, um, I'm not going to be able to process it back out in my own words but its been making me think about how much we rely on mass-produced everything and the way that that really affects the community, because we can't relate to who made our tools for us and everything becomes um infinitley available to us; therefore, everything is pointless becuase we don't appreciate it. And so that extends then to people. When we treat our objects as infinitely available and therefore disposable, you do the same to people. So that is why I love objects and treat them like sacred things even if that for me, usually is ready-made simple, things. You know? Maybe mass-produced but treating them like they are hand-made. So that is my art.</font>

<b><marquee behavior="slide" direction="left">What kind of art did you study in college?</marquee></b></font>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font size "7"><p style="text-indent: 80px">Alright the first part's easy. I attended Washington University in St. Louis and I majored in Communication Design. Um which was a two-year um concentration that followed two years of a studio art foundation program. Um help me with the next part of the question. What was it again?

<b>What was the meaning art to you in the speficic momemt in your life?</b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font size "7"><p style="text-indent: 80px">So um, I'm not sure if I knew what I was making at the time. I have since thought back on this time of my life and I understand better what I think I was trying to accomplish both in high school and then college. But I didn't have, and I'll tell you that after I tell you what I think I was thinking at the time. At the time, um, I thought that art was discursive because that is what was being taught to me, that it was about philosophical discourse. Um, what I felt, after spending a semester in Florence, with our shared mentor, Regan Wheat, was that art was very much a way of seeing and a way of being and a way I could be in the world and look at the world. It was probably my first um experience pf being given permission to, not just embrace, but really investigate my own erotisicsm as an artist. Like what do I like and how do I like it and why do I like it? What do I want to see it become? Um it's not that you don't get tastes of that in a K-12 experience or like a suburban upbrining but I think it was the first time I was allowed to dig into it and validate it in doing that. Immediately chsoe to major in communication design, um, and some of that I was doing because of internalized capitalism and fear but I think some of it had to do with that there was something sticky for me about word and image and design and utility. And of course that is devalued in art historical contexts that see art as soleyl philosophical and discursive. So I was being taught a lot of binaries including the binary between art and design. Um, and I have since looked back at the things I was making um in high school and in my design program. I don't know what I was going in the inbetween, wait there was a self-portrait I made, and I think what I was trying to do was decolonize my art education. And figure out how the tradition, the creative traditons of my ancestors and from my culture, fit inside this definition, this word. And I had no guidance in doing this, there were professors in my design program that ran a program in India everyyear, and I didn't find out about it until it was probably outside the scope of what I would be able to do, um, and so I actually, rather than embracing or um, being excited by that program, being very turned off by the program. Maybe for some reasons that are related to, I mean I think, at this basic level, here's a program where a bunch of white kids went to India to learn about the ways in which design is embedded in the village cultures there and as a part of the way of life, which is true for most indigenous cultures, but I didn't have ccess to it, but I didn't have access to it so I felt boxed out of my own culture. Um, a lot of my projects related to south-asian culture in one way or another from a young age, and yeah and that was what I was trying to do and I didn't know how these things had been so siloed in my expeirnce of them, fit together.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
    <b>Once you left "art school" and the confines of that, how did things change and how did your perception change?</b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font size "7"><p style="text-indent: 80px"> Well first things first, I was focused on being employed. Um, which started me working in custom framing and a local art supply store while I looked for a white collar job, which I got at the Natural Histoy Museum in New York City. So, I the got into exhbition deisgn and spent the next decade in that field and that world in house and in client services. I got to make a lot for things both expicity in art- related institutions and not, um, and so I as squarely in the field of applied arts and having my mind open to different possibilites for applied arts. At the same time, all the people I was meeting and working with, a huge number of them, a large percentage, had a creative practices that they were doing outside of their jobs. Um, and my own creative pursuits outside of my paid job, never felt real or special to me, or like Art with a capital A. And I still don't know that I really think of the things that I do as Art with a capital A. Um, but I'm realziing that Art with a capital A. might not exist. So yeah, there was so much unlearning happening but letting go of those things took years. And I think I came out of my education, I had since abandoned Art with a capital A, because I had chosen Design with a capital D, but I was attached to that capital letter that...I had such a dismissive attitude towards design with a lowercase d and art with a lowercase a, that I missed a lot for many years. A lot of beauty that was happening around me and so it took a long time, it was only when I sort of decided to commit to my own salvation that I, um, gave other poeple permission in my environment to own their own creativity and legitimize their creativity. In 2019 I quit my job and now I'm a pregnant creative, domestic, person. And there are things I want to make, and I am figuring out how to combine the resources and how to make those things happen but the first resources I need and the hardest to summon are the ones that are inside of me, nurtured or taken away from me, so it's 2022. So it has bee 3 years and I am still trying to light that fire inside. But it's a better place than the place where I don't believe the fire exists. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>How do you fit it into your day-to-day life?</b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font size "7"><p style="text-indent: 80px">(Shows me a strip of light shining on her wall.)
My heart is so filled to hear that art is so part of my everyday life in a way that I have dismissed. How I incoporate it maybe is this habit that I haven't appreciated that I have of noticing when something gives me pause. I guess I taste it a little bit. I think on my good days I'm able to taste these things a little bit more. Reagan said something recently, after our time together, I scheudles a critique with her. She told me to start noticing, she said some of the things I had made were wonky shapes that I had chosen to like elevate and honor by putting them on the page. She gave me some advice, something along the lines of continuing to notice and have empathy for these shapes. And so those words have somehow stuck with me and it has been happenign a lot. I am in a new house and I have jsut been noticng wonky things and occasionally I'll docuemnt tgem, I think I've done that once or twice, but mostly I'm just noticjg and having empathy for imperfect things um and I think it is healing. So much of a design eduaiton, it's a self-selecting group, we like to have things align on a grid and so cultivsting empathy for things has been a really great way to love this state of becoming that is the human condition actually. A great prepartuon for being parent. Becuase nobody wants a perfectionist parent, so its messy, and this child is going to grow up into a messy home and I don't like mess so there is this interesting tension so like a happy mom is a good mom, so figuring out how to make our home more aestheically pleasing to me is a directive of mine, becuase it's not like one has to tolerate mess all the time but while it is there to not be so distressed by it is also a skill. My husband has taught me by being himself. (laughs) It has bee a great way to toelrate mess, and not just tolerate but love it. I think that is, in some ways, art and design. My husband has been a great educator in bringing out and reframing creativeiy and artistry for me. Because he is a hacker at heart. He makes beauty out of mess. Like for him the mess is his paint palette. Oh there's a clothepin there let's like hack this, he's been using the srpings and stuff, using them to attach things. The craft is not necessarily great but it works and um they are great prototypes for things that could be more permanent. And not fall aprt after ten uses they are functional and uninhibited the things that he makes and its exciting to see that too. For me its like you know I have to sit and start my Work with a capital W before I can solve this problem. And hes well here you go and I'm like its ugly and its going to fall apart but also when youre like experiencing the pace and the blows of everyday life sometimes you just need to stick a clothespin and a rubber band together and thats it and its going to work and honestly by the time you were making it better or capital P Perfect, the need would have gone anyway. And that is the greated difference between being in school and not. Living life and creating at the pace that life demands which is something that I have learned to pay attentuon to through Colum, these drawings which are destroyed daily by anture, and then creating daiuly by people. And it's a real education in the ephemerality of everyhting we make. So clothespin and the rubber band are ephemeral but so is if I used a fancy clasp from the sotre and painted it gold. It's going to fall apart too. Where is it importand whre things last and wehre to we put the resouces and energy. We visted an Eco-village called Dancing Rabbit in northern Missouri and I learned in a nautal building workwshop where they talked about natural building, they said a phrase. I grew with a mom who sort of, was lviing in a way in this way on a regular basis. How to use resouce for various reasns in domestically, and she had been traine din making this calculation, embodied energy. It is what it saounds like. WHat you are using, what invest of energy does it represent, both in terms of how many calories are in, how muchb of the sun's ebergy is in. How long did it take to get here? How much fossil fuel? How much time to gather and make it. What is an appropraite sue of that amount of eergy. The house I gew up in, we didn't write on fresh pieces of paper, but wrote on used paper from her work. And that is one of the million things I grew up around. And my art educaiton is the one that didn't address that at all. But in living real life it becomes obvious, and as sociaety we are looking at systems that are very short-sighted so one of the ways creativity is showing up in this new doemstic life in this house we bought, with a kid on the way, we are trying to be more thoughtful on hopw we use mateurals in our home. Which means more mess. Becasye when you don't jsut go to Michael's and buy the thing and bring it home, or buy it on Amzon and stuck it on the wall, it takes more time, so this is acually where the eprfectionist part of me can find its role. Organization is what makes thes projects viable and not fall aprt and not have a palce for everyhing. I think allowing that part of me some space to show up and takle ontrol; without all the baggage that that brings along with it, I'mnot really sure how to use those inate talents for orgnaizationa nd project managament and noticing when the thing is out of palce wothout the baggage of like shame or inditemment of our value or wroht showng up which I think how capitalism, a sconstruc, has tended to use those parts of me and co-op them and I'm trying to take them back.

<marquee behavior="slide" direction="left"><b>What do you think art could do? Reflecting on your own art education what do wish you had been told?</b></marquee></font>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font size "7"><p style="text-indent: 80px">I wish my education has been framed inside white Christian supremacy. So that I could understand that it was one way of doing and looking and being and not the way. And acually being really residtatn with Regan, as much as I want to, but so much of the isntruction in a way that is inspring, is rooted in showing us other works and showing us a sotry and naarative and I just don't know what palce I have in that story. And I want an alterantive art hsitroy to locate myself in. So i am really conscious about choosing to spend my time and energy with a history that is alientating to me but even that is a pricless. It may not be that I can't get something out of that, I don't know. I don't feel like investing in it. I still don't if that's cutting my nose to spite my face. I wish that my educaition then and the education I continue to seek out had been framed within these larger cultural forces that create them. I wish they had been more self-aware. I don't think any one person or institution can unwind these things on its own, but even a little bit of seld-wareness that is like this is what we are and this is what we aren't, this is what we knwo, this is what we do know, would help I think soomeone like me, or all students, all artist in formation, impressionale minds, to leave a little space for some questions. Becuase even if Wshington University didn't habe the answers for me, I think it would have been grat to knwo that there were questions in the first place. So I could I could those answers out somehwere else.
