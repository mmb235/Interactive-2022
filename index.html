      <h4>About me</h4>
      <p>       I am primarily a figurative artist. <p>My art, either consciously or subconsciously, focuses and draws inspiration from the body. <p>The way I depict the human figure has evolved greatly, but the underlying thread that runs through all my work is an exploration of the dynamic spaces bodies create. <p>I started as a hyper-realist painter focusing on capturing the exact likeness of my subjects, but found myself fascinated by the structures and, indeed, architectural forms that are created through the interaction of bodies.<p> I continue to paint portraits today but am interested in capturing not only the figures themselves but the charged and tangible space caught between and around them.<p>
