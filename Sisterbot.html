    The dogs filled the enclosed grassy area with exuberance and a diverse offering of activities. Small dogs were playing with even smaller dogs, while the big dogs sipped gin and tonics on the laps of their owners. There was catch, tackle, tag, and even neutered humping. It was almost like being at a kid’s birthday party but without the annoyance of children. 

      <p>
  The park was peaceful. No barking, but just the gentle tittering of the dog’s owners circled around and gossiping about Samantha’s new curly-haired snookifrabino named Lily, who apparently was afflicted with nightmare growling, a common trait of her breed. She was Samantha’s sixth “Lily” and counting, and lately Lily had a growing suspicion that her owner only really liked her for silky, spotted coat and not her exceptional ability for smelling marijuana from a mile away.

<p>
  After being told to “get down,” Lily rolled her eyes and trotted over to the hubbub in the center of the park. She paused for a second, looking up at the smoggy sky, and thought to herself, “Is there more than this acre of trodden-on grass? Will I ever find myself here?” but was quickly interrupted by Hammer, the Broad-backed, short-haired, Scottish Surger, chomping down on her velvety ear. She chased him around in circles, pausing once to sniff an unknown shit, only to find it was her own.
  <p>
  “Is everything okay with Lily?”, Susan, the owner of Maggot, a highly intelligent Cobble-tailed terrier, asked Audrey. 
  “Oh yes she’s fine. The vet told me that with her heightened intelligence comes bouts of existential dread. Isn’t that like the cutest thing you’ve ever heard?” The women laughed and continued to chat, still wearing their robes and Ugg slippers, while Winston, the fourteen-year old Gorkle, ran and retrieved his favorite orange ball from his owner, over and over and over again.</div>
